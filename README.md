Altering Object Properties
In this game, you control a ball as it navigates across rectangular planks. The color of the ball changes to green when the ball touches the rotating square. To start playing, click on the ball. Use the following controls to guide the ball:

- Right Arrow Key: Move the ball forward.
- Upward Arrow Key:Make the ball jump.
- Left Arrow Key:Move the ball backward.

Your goal is to move the ball from one rectangular plank to another without letting it touch the floor. Ensure smooth navigation and avoid falling off the planks to achieve success in the game.
